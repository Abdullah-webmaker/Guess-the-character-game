# Guess-the-Character-Game 🎭

Welcome to **Guess-the-Character-Game**, where the *characters* are *wildly unpredictable*, and the answers are *totally wrong*! This README will guide you through a quirky and error-packed adventure. Ready? Let’s go!

## 🎮 The Setup

You’ve got a *serious* question to answer, but instead of getting a legit response, you’ll pick between two **wacky characters** to give you the answer. Sounds like a good idea, right? But wait—here’s the twist:

### Both Characters Are Wrong! 🤡
That’s right—pick either character and they’ll send you down a rabbit hole of complete nonsense. They know nothing! Zip. Nada. Zilch. So choose wisely… or not!

## 🚀 What Happens Next?

Once you choose your character, you’ll be hit with a **glorious error page**. *Boom!* A totally wrong decision leads to an epic failure. And guess what? That’s the fun! 🎉
